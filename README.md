# AA Questions

## Description
We will build an application that will help us handle questions from students. To do this, we will set up the database and then overlay Ruby code to map the data from the database into Ruby objects in memory that we can work with. Our database queries (written in SQL) will live within our Ruby code.

## Learning Goals
Know how to use a SQL script to construct a database
  Be able to debug SQL syntax errors
Be able to use queries, written in SQL, in your Ruby code
Know how a basic ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system works
Be able to write SQL queries to solve problems without using Ruby code
  Be able to use joins instead of Ruby code
  Be able to use GROUP BY and ORDER BY instead of Ruby code
